# MSYS2 Cookbook

This cookbook will install [MSYS2](https://msys2.github.io/) and has LWRPs to interact with the MSYS2 environment.

This was built as an alternative for [mingw](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/mingw) that focuses moreso on the MSYS2 environment and allows you to utilize MSYS2 like a small UNIX environment within your Windows node.

## Platform

- Windows

## Recipes

- default: Will install MSYS2, optionally update all of the packages, and optionally install packages set in the attributes.

## Resources
